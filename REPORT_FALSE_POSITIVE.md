# How to Report False Positive to Google Safe Browsing

## Your Site URL
`https://ganeshanushka.github.io/tardle/`

## Steps to Report:

1. **Visit Google Safe Browsing Report Page:**
   - Go to: https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_error/

2. **Fill out the form:**
   - **URL:** `https://ganeshanushka.github.io/tardle/`
   - **What type of problem are you reporting?** Select: "I think this is a false positive"
   - **Additional details:** You can mention:
     - "This is a legitimate word game website (Tardle) hosted on GitHub Pages"
     - "The site uses only trusted CDNs (Firebase, Font Awesome, jsdelivr)"
     - "No malicious code or suspicious content detected"
     - "Recent commits show only legitimate feature additions"

3. **Submit the form**

## Alternative: Check Site Status

Visit this URL to see the current Safe Browsing status:
https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search?url=https://ganeshanushka.github.io/tardle/

## Expected Timeline

- Google typically reviews false positive reports within **24-48 hours**
- The warning should be removed if confirmed as a false positive

## Temporary Workaround

If you need to access the site immediately:
1. On the warning page, click "Details"
2. Click "Visit this unsafe site" (only if you're certain it's safe)
3. Note: This is just a workaround and doesn't fix the underlying issue
